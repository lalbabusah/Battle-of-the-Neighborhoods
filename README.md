In this project, we will compare the neighborhoods of Toronto. Since there are lots of venues in neighborhoods of Toronto we will try to detect which type of venues are more common in Neighborhoods.

Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in finding which venues are more common or not in the neighborhoods of Toronto.

We will use data science to generate a few most promising neighborhoods based on these criteria. The advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that the best possible final venue can be chosen by stakeholders.
